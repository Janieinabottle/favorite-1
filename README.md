clay making

Sculpting is one of my favorite passtimes. My favorite clay is sculpty clay, as it is malleable, colorful and iconic. I like to use the colored clay, rather than paint over it, for a more cartoon-like finish.

# materials
1. sculpty clay
2. wire for support
3. carving tools (anything that will make you more precise or create the texture you'd like)
4. a regular shmegular oven
